Acts As Addressable
===================

Created by Juergen Fesslmeier

This plugin is based on the Xelipe ActsAsAddressable code. It allows for addresses
to be added to multiple and different models. For example, you can add named addresses
such as :billing or :shipping address to your addressable models.

The plugin provides RSpecs, run with "rake spec:plugins"

== Resources
