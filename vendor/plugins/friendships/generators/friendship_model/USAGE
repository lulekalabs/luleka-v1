Description:
    The friendship_model generator creates a Role model for use with the Friendships plugin.

    The generator takes a model name as its argument, which at this time must be 'Friendship'.

    The generator creates a self referential Frienship model class in app/models, a test suite in
    test/unit, test fixtures in test/fixtures/friendships.yml, and a migration in db/migrate.

Example:
    ./script/generate friendship_model Friendship

    This will create a Role model:
        Model:      app/models/friendship.rb
        Test:       test/unit/friendship_test.rb
        Fixtures:   test/fixtures/friendships.yml
        Migration:  db/migrate/XXX_add_friendships.rb
        
    You should then run "rake migrate".
