##<a name="why">Why Luleka?</a>

We think that interchange of information between consumers (e.g. customers, citizens, users, etc.) and producers (e.g. companies, governments, brands, etc.) have an enormous potential for improvement. Although, the range of customer engagement channels is huge: 800-service-numbers, contact forms, after purchase surveys, support forums, email, chat messaging, etc. they deflect from the real issues, still making communication impersonal, painful or disrespectful.

First with forums and blogs now with Facebook and Twitter and thousands of places online, people are willing to talk about their issues with anyone who'll listen and expertise is only a google search away. It turns out that the folks with questions, problems and new ideas are people most engaged and they often answer each others question as effectively as the support staff. These are the very people that the product and marketing folks are dying to connect with. Some of the biggest companies in the world are now going to where their customers are.

We want to give organizations and communities the opportunity to take an active role in their consumer lives without trying to own the relationship. We are creating a space to enable personal, effortless and respectful conversations of a high standard. Searching for an answer, posting an idea, should ideally get a ready and valid feedback.

##<a name="what">What's Luleka?</a>

Luleka is a network of customer communities that treats producers and consumers as equal partners. Luleka is a place where people come together to answer questions solve problems and share ideas and always trusting that they are treated fairly. Unlike a traditional forum, Luleka is focused on quality outcomes. Our job is to provide the tools to help achieve and measure results.

We are there for the whole relationship from pre-purchase decision making, to learning how to use the product, to fostering expertise in the community and ultimately collaborating on new products. We want to bridge the gap between customer support and professional services.

The name _lu-le-ka_ stems from the [Zulu](http://www.isizulu.net/) language of South Africa and means _counsel_, _advise_, _guide_. It is in the spirit of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_(philosophy)">Ubuntu Philosophie</a> of focusing on people's allegiances and relations with each other. In essence, "I am because you are."

##<a name="how">How Luleka Works</a>

The quality of content on Luleka is based on the collective contributions of our users (i.e. you!). We combine aspects of Forums, Blogs, Wikis and a _Digg-like_ experience in a way that <em>we</em> think is fun to use. 

You contribute to Luleka by starting conversations and replying to conversations, by orbiting communities, conversations and people, and by voting, liking, following and flagging content. In order to make Luleka's conversations better and more valuable for everyone, we incentivize you to do all of these things!

You can register if you want to collect reputation in form of real cash, but otherwise, it's just free. Reputation is never given, it is earned by convincing other users that you know what you're talking about, so it is a rough measure of how much the community trusts you. Reputation is completely optional and normal use of Luleka, that is starting and replying to conversations, does not require any reputation whatsoever.

Luleka has a few simple [guidelines](http://luleka.com/guidelines) meant to keep our service interesting, fun and useful for everyone.
